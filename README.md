# HyperspectralClassification

Project Title: Superpixel-based spectral classification for the detection of head and neck cancer with hyperspectral imaging.

Details: Performed machine learning and image processing techniques to 11 mice each with a large dataset. Applied PCA feature extraction to reduce the number of bands to 2 principal components. Performed image clustering with superpixels to reduce computation. Utilized R-SVM to train the model and classify tumor. Used a leave-one-out cross-validation on 11 mice dataset and obtained an average 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity over 11 mice. Reduced total computation time from days to less than 15 minutes. 

Submitted first author and presented paper at 2016 SPIE Medical Imaging: Precision Medicine conference as an oral talk.
